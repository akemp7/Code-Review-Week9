# _Anita Kemp's Word Counter_

#### _A console app to check the token frequency of a word in a sentence as part of the week 9 code review at Epicodus, 10/4/19._

#### By _**Anita Kemp**_

## Description

_This program will allow the user to enter a sentence and a word of interest. It will then check how many times the word appears in the user sentence. It will then return to the user a word count._

## Specifications

| Behavior | Input | Output | Explanation|
| -------- | :---------: | :---------: | :----------:|
|The program will disregard numeric input for token count | "10" | "Please enter a sentence and word" | This is in order to control for unexpected user input|
|The program will disregard upper case letters| "Cat is the name of my pet." | "cat is the name of my pet."| This will ensure a more accurate token count|
| The program will return instances of a specified word from the user.| "cat" "The cat was friends with another "cat" | "cat" "cat"| This is to ensure that the program is getting all instances of the specified word, and not getting a word like "cathedral"|
| The program will also return all instances of cat even with different affixes| "The cats are friends with cat one and cat two"| "cats" "cat" "cat" | In order to find all of the instances of cat"|
| The program will perform a token count| "cat" "cat" "cat" | Token Count: 3 | Having generated all instances of the token, it should now be able to return a count|
